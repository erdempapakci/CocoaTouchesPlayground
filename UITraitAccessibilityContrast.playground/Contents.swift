/*
 Accessibility Traits: Accessibility traits are attributes that provide additional information about how a user interface element should be treated by assistive technologies, such as VoiceOver. UITraitAccessibilityContrast is one of these traits.
 Contrast Levels: UITraitAccessibilityContrast indicates the contrast level of a UI element's text or graphics against its background. It helps users with visual impairments understand the content more easily.
 Contrast Levels: The trait can have the following values:
 .unspecified: The contrast level is not specified.
 .normal: The contrast level is considered normal, meaning that the element has good contrast and is easily readable or distinguishable.
 .high: The contrast level is considered high, indicating that the element has very good contrast and is highly readable or distinguishable.
 Usage: You can set the accessibilityTraits property of a UI element, such as a UILabel or UIButton, to include .traitAccessibilityContrast. Then, you can set the specific contrast level using the accessibilityTraits property
