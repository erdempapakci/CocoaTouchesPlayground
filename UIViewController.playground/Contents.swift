/*
 
UIViewController is a crucial class in iOS development that manages a view's presentation and user interaction. Here's what it represents:

1. View Controller: UIViewController serves as a controller for a single view, acting as an intermediary between the app's data and the user interface.

2. User Interface Management: UIViewController is responsible for managing the view hierarchy, handling user interactions, and coordinating with model data.

3. UIKit Framework: UIViewController is part of the UIKit framework, which is essential for creating iOS user interfaces. Importing UIKit provides access to UIViewController and other UI-related classes and utilities.

In your code, you create custom UIViewController subclasses to control the behavior of specific screens or views within your app. Each UIViewController represents a distinct screen or part of your app's user interface.

import UIKit

// Importing UIKit framework to use UIViewController.

// Create a custom class named MyViewController that derives from UIViewController.
class MyViewController: UIViewController {
    // This class inherits from UIViewController, which is a fundamental class for managing a view's presentation and user interaction.

    // You can override UIViewController's methods to customize the view controller's behavior and respond to view lifecycle events.

    // For example, you can override viewDidLoad() to perform setup tasks when the view controller loads.
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        // Custom setup code can be added here.
    }
 

    // You can add custom methods and properties to tailor the view controller's functionality to your app's requirements.
}

// To use this custom view controller, you can instantiate it and present it within your app's navigation flow.

// For example:

let customViewController = MyViewController()
// navigationController?.pushViewController(customViewController, animated: true)

// This code creates an instance of MyViewController and pushes it onto the navigation stack to display a new screen within a navigation controller.
