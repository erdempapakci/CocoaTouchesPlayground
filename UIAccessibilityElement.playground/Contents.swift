/*
UIAccessibilityElement is a class in the UIKit framework that allows you to create custom accessible elements in your iOS app's user interface. Accessibility elements provide information about on-screen content to assistive technologies like VoiceOver, making your app more accessible to users with disabilities. Here's what UIAccessibilityElement represents:

1. Custom Accessibility Elements: UIAccessibilityElement enables you to define custom accessible elements that may not have a corresponding UIKit control. You can use it to provide accessibility information for any on-screen content, including custom-drawn graphics, non-standard user interface elements, or complex composite views.

2. Accessibility Properties: You can set various accessibility properties for a UIAccessibilityElement, such as the element's frame, accessibility label, traits, and custom actions. These properties describe the element's role, state, and behavior to assistive technologies.

3. VoiceOver Integration: Accessibility elements are used in conjunction with VoiceOver, an iOS screen reader. When VoiceOver is active, it relies on accessibility elements to provide spoken descriptions and interaction hints to users with visual impairments.

4. Fine-Grained Control: UIAccessibilityElement allows you to provide fine-grained control over the accessibility experience of your app. You can specify how VoiceOver should announce, navigate, and interact with your custom elements.

5. Custom Drawing: You can use UIAccessibilityElement to associate accessibility information with custom-drawn graphics or non-standard controls that don't inherit from standard UIKit classes.

Here's a basic example of how to create and use a UIAccessibilityElement to make a custom-drawn element accessible:
*/

import UIKit

class CustomDrawingView: UIView {
    override func draw(_ rect: CGRect) {
        // Custom drawing code here
        
        // Create a UIAccessibilityElement for the custom-drawn element
        let customElement = UIAccessibilityElement(accessibilityContainer: self)
        customElement.accessibilityLabel = "Custom Drawing Element"
        customElement.accessibilityFrameInContainerSpace = CGRect(x: 20, y: 20, width: 100, height: 100)
        
        // Register the accessibility element
        UIAccessibility.post(notification: .layoutChanged, argument: customElement)
    }
}
