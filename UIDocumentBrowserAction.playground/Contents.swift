/*
 UIDocumentBrowserAction is a class in UIKit on iOS that allows you to define custom actions for documents in a document browser view controller. It is part of the Document-Based App architecture and is used to add functionality to documents within a document browser interface.

 Here are key points about UIDocumentBrowserAction:

 Document Browser: A document browser view controller (UIDocumentBrowserViewController) provides a user interface for browsing and managing documents. UIDocumentBrowserAction is used to extend the functionality of this interface.
 Custom Actions: You can create instances of UIDocumentBrowserAction to define custom actions that can be performed on documents. These actions can include operations like renaming, deleting, copying, moving, or custom operations specific to your app.
 Appearance and Behavior: You can customize the appearance and behavior of each action, including its title, image, and availability based on the selected documents or their states.
 Contextual Menu: UIDocumentBrowserAction can be used to add custom items to the contextual menu that appears when the user long-presses on a document or selects multiple documents.
 Integration: You typically define and configure UIDocumentBrowserAction instances in your app's Info.plist file, specifying their titles, icons, and target methods. The actions are then automatically presented to the user within the document browser interface.
