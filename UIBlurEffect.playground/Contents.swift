/*
UIBlurEffect is a class in UIKit that represents a visual effect used to apply a blur to the content behind a view. It's commonly used to add a frosted glass or translucency effect to elements in your iOS user interfaces, creating a visually appealing and context-aware user experience.

Here's what you need to know about UIBlurEffect:

1. Visual Enhancement: UIBlurEffect is designed to enhance the visual appeal of your app's user interface by applying a blur effect to the background content. This can help draw attention to foreground elements, improve readability, and create a sense of depth and context.

2. Variants: There are three variants of UIBlurEffect that you can choose from, each with a different level of blur:
   - UIBlurEffect.Style.light: This style applies a light blur effect, suitable for creating subtle translucency.
   - UIBlurEffect.Style.extraLight: This style applies an even lighter blur, ideal for creating an airy and delicate appearance.
   - UIBlurEffect.Style.dark: This style applies a dark blur, often used to create a sense of depth or contrast.

3. Usage: You typically apply a UIBlurEffect to a UIVisualEffectView, which is a view designed to host visual effects. You can add subviews to this visual effect view, and the blur effect will be applied to the content behind it. This allows you to control the level of blur and apply it to specific portions of your user interface.

Here's a simple example of how to use UIBlurEffect to add a blur effect to a view:

*/

import UIKit

class MyViewController: UIViewController {
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        // Create a visual effect view with a blur effect style.
        let blurEffect = UIBlurEffect(style: .light)
        let visualEffectView = UIVisualEffectView(effect: blurEffect)
        
        // Set the frame and add it to the view hierarchy.
        visualEffectView.frame = view.bounds
        view.addSubview(visualEffectView)
        
        // Add other UI elements or content to the visual effect view.
    }
}
