/*
 Word Suggestions: A UILexicon instance contains a list of words and phrases that the user has used in the past or that are common in the user's language. These words can be used to provide better word suggestions or autocomplete features in custom keyboards or text input interfaces.
 Custom Keyboard Extensions: Custom keyboard extensions, which can be created using the UIInputViewController, can access the UILexicon to provide more context-aware and relevant text predictions to users.
 Autocorrection and Prediction: By analyzing the lexicon, you can offer better autocorrection suggestions as users type, which can help improve the accuracy and speed of text input.
