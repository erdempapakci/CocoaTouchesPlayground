/*
 NSData and its mutable subclass NSMutable​Data provide data objects, object-oriented wrappers for byte buffers. Data objects let simple allocated buffers (that is, data with no embedded pointers) take on the behavior of Foundation objects.

 NSData creates static data objects, and NSMutable​Data creates dynamic data objects. NSData and NSMutable​Data are typically used for data storage and are also useful in Distributed Objects applications, where data contained in data objects can be copied or moved between applications.
