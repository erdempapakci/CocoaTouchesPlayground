/*
 NSProxy is an abstract class in Apple's Foundation framework that serves as a base class for creating proxy objects. Proxy objects, in general, are used to represent and forward messages (method calls) to other objects. NSProxy provides a foundation for creating custom proxy objects in Objective-C. This class is particularly useful when you want to build custom proxy objects that forward messages to other objects, such as forwarding messages to objects of different classes or types.

 Key points about NSProxy:

 Abstract Base Class: You don't typically use NSProxy directly; it's an abstract base class that you can subclass to create your custom proxy objects. Subclasses of NSProxy need to override the forwardInvocation(_:) method to specify how to forward messages.
 Message Forwarding: A primary use of NSProxy is to forward messages to other objects. When a message is sent to a proxy object, the proxy can route the message to a target object for processing.
 Dynamic Object Composition: NSProxy can be used to dynamically compose or switch objects at runtime, allowing you to switch between different implementations or behaviors without changing the code that uses the proxy.
 Flexible Proxy Logic: By creating custom proxy subclasses, you have full control over how messages are forwarded, which allows for various proxy behaviors and transformations.
