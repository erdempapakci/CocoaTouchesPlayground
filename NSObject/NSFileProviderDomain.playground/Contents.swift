/*
 NSFileProviderDomain is a class in Apple's File Provider framework, introduced in iOS 11 and later, that allows developers to implement file provider extensions for their apps. These extensions enable apps to expose their files and directories to the system, making them available in the Files app and other apps that work with documents.

 A NSFileProviderDomain instance represents a domain in which a file provider extension operates. A domain is essentially a container for files and directories that your app wants to make accessible to other apps and services on the device.

 Key features and concepts related to NSFileProviderDomain include:

 File Provider Extension: To implement a file provider extension for your app, you need to create a class that conforms to the NSFileProviderExtension protocol. This extension is responsible for interacting with the system and responding to file requests.
 Document Storage: The file provider extension allows you to define the storage location for documents provided by your app. These documents are typically stored in a directory within your app's sandbox, and the extension serves as the bridge between this local storage and the Files app.
 Domains: A NSFileProviderDomain represents a specific container for files and directories provided by your app. You can have multiple domains if you want to organize your files into different categories or sections.
 Item Identifiers: Items (files and directories) within a domain are identified by unique item identifiers. These identifiers are used to locate and retrieve specific items within a domain.
 Sync and Offline Access: The file provider extension supports automatic synchronization of your documents with the Files app, and it allows users to access files even when the device is offline.
 Offline Storage: Files can be cached for offline access, allowing users to work with your app's documents even without an internet connection.
 Access Control: You can control access to your files and directories by specifying permissions and access rights
