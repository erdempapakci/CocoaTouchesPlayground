/*
 NSFileAccessIntent in Swift is a class that represents the details of a coordinated-read or coordinated-write operation. It is used in conjunction with the NSFileCoordinator class to coordinate the reading and writing of files and directories among file presenters.

 To create an NSFileAccessIntent object, you can use the readingIntent(with:options:) or writingIntent(with:options:) class methods. The readingIntent(with:options:) method returns a file access intent object for reading the given URL with the provided options. The writingIntent(with:options:) method returns a file access intent object for writing to the given URL with the provided options.

 Once you have created an NSFileAccessIntent object, you can use it to coordinate the reading and writing of the associated file or directory. To do this, you can pass the file access intent object to the coordinator(with:queue:byAccessor:) method of the NSFileCoordinator class. This method will ensure that the file or directory is accessed in a coordinated manner, even if other file presenters are also accessing it.
