/*
 NSFileSecurity is a class in Apple's Foundation framework that provides a way to represent and manage file system security settings and access control lists (ACLs) for files and directories on macOS and other Unix-based systems. It allows you to work with permissions, ownership, and other security-related attributes of files and directories.

 Here are some of the key concepts and tasks related to NSFileSecurity:

 File Permissions:
 You can use NSFileSecurity to manage the standard file permissions for a file or directory, including read, write, and execute permissions for the owner, group, and others.
 Ownership:
 It allows you to change the owner and group of a file or directory.
 Access Control Lists (ACLs):
 NSFileSecurity supports working with access control lists, which are more fine-grained permission settings beyond the standard Unix file permissions.
 Access Control Entries (ACEs):
 ACEs are individual entries in an ACL that specify which users or groups have specific permissions for a file or directory.
 Inherited Permissions:
 You can control whether permissions are inherited from parent directories in the file system.
 Attributes:
 NSFileSecurity provides methods to query and set various security-related attributes for files and directories.
