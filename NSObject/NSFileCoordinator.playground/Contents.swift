/*
 NSFileCoordinator is a class in Apple's Foundation framework that's used for coordinating file access in a multi-threaded or multi-process environment. It's designed to ensure the safe and orderly access to files, preventing data corruption and conflicts when multiple parts of your application need to read from or write to the same files. File coordination is essential for maintaining data consistency in scenarios where file access is shared among different components of an app.
