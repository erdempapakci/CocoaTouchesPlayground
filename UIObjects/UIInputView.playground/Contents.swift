/*
 UIInputView is a class in Apple's UIKit framework for iOS that allows you to create custom input views for on-screen keyboards. It is typically used to replace the standard system keyboard with a custom input view tailored to the needs of your app.

 Here are some key points about UIInputView:

 Custom Input Views: UIInputView is often used to provide custom input views for text input fields, text views, or other text input controls within your app. These custom input views can include additional buttons, controls, or features that are specific to your app.
 Custom Keyboards: You can use UIInputView to create a custom keyboard for your app. This is useful when you want to offer specialized input methods or features that are not available on the standard system keyboard.
 Customization: With UIInputView, you have full control over the appearance and behavior of the input view. You can design the layout, add buttons, implement gesture recognizers, and handle user interactions.
 Integration: To use a UIInputView in your app, you typically set it as the inputView property of a text input control, such as a UITextField or UITextView. This replaces the standard system keyboard with your custom input view.
 Keyboard Extensions: If you are building a custom keyboard extension for iOS, UIInputView is often used as the primary view for the keyboard. You can create custom layouts and provide unique keyboard functionality within your extension.
