/*
 When the user chooses dictation input on a supported device, the system automatically inserts recognized phrases into the current text view. You can use an object of the UIDictationPhrase class to obtain a string representing a phrase a user has dictated. In the case of ambiguous dictation results, a dictation phrase object provides an array containing alternative strings. Methods in the UITextInput protocol allow your app to respond to the completion of dictation.
