/*
 
 UIResponder is an abstract class in UIKit that provides a common interface for responding to and handling events. All UIKit objects, including views, view controllers, and the application object, are subclasses of UIResponder.

 UIResponders can handle a variety of events, including touch events, motion events, and keyboard events. When an event occurs, the UIKit framework delivers the event to the appropriate UIResponder object. The UIResponder object can then handle the event or pass it on to another UIResponder object.

 To handle an event, a UIResponder object must implement the - (BOOL)respondsToSelector:(SEL)aSelector method. This method returns YES if the UIResponder object can handle the event, and NO otherwise.

 If a UIResponder object returns YES to the - (BOOL)respondsToSelector:(SEL)aSelector method, then the UIKit framework will call the - (void)forwardInvocation:(NSInvocation *)anInvocation method on the UIResponder object. The UIResponder object can then implement the logic for handling the event.

 UIResponders are a fundamental part of the UIKit event handling system. By understanding how UIResponders work, you can create more powerful and responsive user interfaces.

 Here are some examples of how UIResponders can be used in iOS apps:

 To handle touch events, such as taps, swipes, and pinches.
 To handle motion events, such as device acceleration and gyroscope data.
 To handle keyboard events, such as key presses and key releases.
 To implement custom gestures and interactions.
 UIResponders are a powerful tool that can be used to create a variety of user interfaces. By understanding how UIResponders work, you can create more responsive and engaging user interfaces.
