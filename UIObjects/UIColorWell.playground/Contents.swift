/*
 
UIColorWell is a UIKit component introduced in iOS 14 that provides a pre-built color picker button for selecting colors in your iOS apps. It simplifies the process of allowing users to choose colors, making it easy to integrate color selection into your app's user interface.
 
Here are some key points about UIColorWell:
 
1. Color Picker Button: UIColorWell presents a color picker button that displays the currently selected color and allows users to open a color picker interface when tapped.

2. Customization: You can customize the appearance and behavior of the UIColorWell button. You can set an initial color, choose whether to display alpha (transparency) options, and specify the size and style of the button.

3. Integration: UIColorWell is designed for easy integration with other UIKit components. You can place it within a toolbar, navigation bar, or any other UI element where color selection is required.

4. Accessibility: UIColorWell supports accessibility features, making it usable by all users, including those with visual impairments. It includes support for VoiceOver and dynamic type.

5. Interaction: When the user taps the UIColorWell button, it presents a color picker interface, allowing the user to choose a color. You can receive notifications when the selected color changes.

Here's a simple example of how to use UIColorWell to allow the user to pick a color:

import UIKit

class MyViewController: UIViewController {
    let colorWell = UIColorWell()
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        // Create a UIColorWell instance.
       
        colorWell.frame = CGRect(x: 50, y: 50, width: 50, height: 50)
        
        // Set an initial color for the color well.
        colorWell.selectedColor = UIColor.blue
        
        // Add the color well to the view.
        view.addSubview(colorWell)
        
        // Register for color change notifications.
        colorWell.addTarget(self, action: #selector(colorChanged), for: .valueChanged)
    }

    @objc func colorChanged() {
        // Handle color change here.
        let selectedColor = colorWell.selectedColor
        // Use the selectedColor as needed in your app.
    }
}
