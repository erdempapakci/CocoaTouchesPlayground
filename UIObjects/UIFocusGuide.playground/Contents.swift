/*
 UIFocusGuide is a class in Apple's UIKit framework for iOS and tvOS that allows you to create custom focus guides within your user interface to influence the focus behavior of the user when navigating using the Apple TV remote or other input methods. Focus guides are especially useful in complex user interfaces where you need to control the order and direction of focus traversal.
