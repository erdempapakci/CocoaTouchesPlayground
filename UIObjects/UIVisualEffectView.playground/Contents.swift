/*
 UIVisualEffect is an abstract base class in Apple's UIKit framework for iOS and macOS. It is a part of the UIVisualEffectView framework and represents a visual effect that can be applied to views to achieve various visual styles. UIVisualEffect is typically used in conjunction with UIVisualEffectView to apply visual effects to user interface elements, such as blurring or vibrancy.

 UIVisualEffect is an abstract class, and you generally don't create instances of it directly. Instead, you use its concrete subclasses, which represent specific visual effects:

 UIBlurEffect: Represents a visual effect that applies a blur to the contents behind the view. You can adjust the blur's style and intensity using this effect.
 UIVibrancyEffect: Represents a visual effect that enhances the legibility of content by making it stand out from the background. It is often used in combination with UIBlurEffect.
 Custom Visual Effects: You can also create custom visual effects by subclassing UIVisualEffect and implementing your own rendering methods. However, this is an advanced topic and typically not needed for most applications.

class ViewController: UIViewController {
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        // Create a view to apply the blur effect to
        let contentView = UIView(frame: CGRect(x: 50, y: 50, width: 200, height: 200))
        contentView.backgroundColor = .white

        // Create a blur effect
        let blurEffect = UIBlurEffect(style: .dark)

        // Create a visual effect view with the blur effect
        let visualEffectView = UIVisualEffectView(effect: blurEffect)
        visualEffectView.frame = contentView.bounds

        // Add the visual effect view to the content view
        contentView.addSubview(visualEffectView)

        // Add the content view to the view controller's view
        view.addSubview(contentView)
    }
