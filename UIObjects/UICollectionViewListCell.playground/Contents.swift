UICollectionViewListCell is a class in UIKit introduced in iOS 15 for creating cells with list-style content in a UICollectionView. It's designed for building user interfaces that resemble lists and supports hierarchical data structures.

Key points about UICollectionViewListCell:

1. List-Style Layout: UICollectionViewListCell is optimized for displaying content in a list format, making it suitable for use cases like tables, outlines, and hierarchical data. It aligns with UIKit's new list-based design principles introduced in iOS 15.

2. Hierarchical Structure: This cell type is particularly useful when you need to present data hierarchically, such as in outline views. You can nest UICollectionViewListCell instances to represent parent-child relationships in your data.

3. UIKit Integration: UICollectionViewListCell integrates seamlessly with UICollectionView and takes full advantage of UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout for defining complex, adaptive layouts.

4. Predefined Styles: UICollectionViewListCell offers various predefined styles, such as plain, grouped, and inset, which you can apply to create different list appearances. These styles align with Apple's Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) for consistent UI design.

5. Customization: While UICollectionViewListCell provides predefined styles, you can also customize its appearance and content. You can add custom views, configure content, and respond to user interactions like any other UITableViewCell or UICollectionViewCell.

6. Swift UI Integration: UICollectionViewListCell is part of UIKit, but it works well in conjunction with SwiftUI, allowing you to combine UIKit's list-style cells with SwiftUI views in hybrid apps.

Here's an example of how to use UICollectionViewListCell to create a simple list-style cell:

*/
import UIKit



//collectionView = UICollectionView(frame: view.bounds, collectionViewLayout: UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout.list(using: .init(appearance: .plain)))
