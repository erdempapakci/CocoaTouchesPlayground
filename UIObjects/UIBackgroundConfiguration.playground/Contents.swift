/*
UIBackgroundConfiguration is a class introduced in iOS 14 and later as part of UIKit's modernized way of configuring the background of views. It allows you to define the appearance and behavior of a view's background, making it easier to create custom cell and view styles in iOS user interfaces.

Here's what UIBackgroundConfiguration represents and how it's typically used:

1. Background Configuration: UIBackgroundConfiguration is used to configure the background of views, such as table view cells, collection view cells, and other UI elements that require customizable backgrounds.

2. Elements Composition: It provides a composition-based approach to defining backgrounds. You can combine various elements like a background color, a custom image, and visual effects to create a background style that suits your app's design.

3. Dynamic Behavior: UIBackgroundConfiguration is dynamic, meaning it can adapt to system-wide changes like dark mode and accessibility settings. You can specify different background configurations for light and dark appearances, ensuring a consistent user experience.

4. Reusability: It's designed to work well with reusable views and cells. When cells are reused, the configuration ensures that the background is updated appropriately for the new content.

5. Easy Customization: You can customize various aspects of the background, including setting a background color, adding a custom background image, configuring insets, and applying visual effects.

Here's an example of how to create a UIBackgroundConfiguration and use it to configure the background of a UITableViewCell:

*/

import UIKit

// Create a background configuration for a table view cell.
var backgroundConfig = UIBackgroundConfiguration.listPlainCell()

// Customize the background configuration.
backgroundConfig.backgroundColor = .systemBackground
backgroundConfig.cornerRadius = 10
backgroundConfig.strokeColor = .systemGray
backgroundConfig.strokeWidth = 1.0

// Apply the configuration to a table view cell.
let cell = UITableViewCell(style: .default, reuseIdentifier: "cell")
cell.backgroundConfiguration = backgroundConfig
