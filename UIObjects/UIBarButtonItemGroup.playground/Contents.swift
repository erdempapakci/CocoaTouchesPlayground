/*
UIBarButtonItemGroup is a class introduced in iOS 14 and later as part of UIKit's modernized approach to managing and customizing groups of bar button items within toolbars and menus. It allows you to define and manage the behavior and appearance of groups of bar button items in your iOS app.

Here's what UIBarButtonItemGroup represents and how it's typically used:

1. Grouping Bar Button Items: UIBarButtonItemGroup is used to group multiple UIBarButtonItem instances together, defining their layout and behavior as a cohesive unit. This is particularly useful for organizing related actions within toolbars and menus.

2. Customization of Group Behavior: It allows you to customize the behavior of the group, including whether it should collapse into a single item when space is limited, how it responds to user interactions, and how it adapts to system-wide changes like dark mode.

3. Layout and Alignment: You can specify the layout and alignment of bar button items within the group, including their placement in the leading or trailing edge of a toolbar.

4. Dynamic Adaptation: Similar to other modern UIKit components, UIBarButtonItemGroup is designed to adapt to system-wide changes such as dark mode and accessibility settings, ensuring a consistent and accessible user interface.
