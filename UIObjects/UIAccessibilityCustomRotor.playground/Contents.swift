/*
UIAccessibilityCustomRotor is a class in the UIKit framework that allows you to define custom rotor items for VoiceOver users in your iOS app. Rotors are navigation aids that allow users to quickly access and interact with specific types of content or elements on the screen. Custom rotors can enhance the accessibility of your app by providing efficient navigation options for users with disabilities. Here's what UIAccessibilityCustomRotor represents:

1. Custom Rotor Items: UIAccessibilityCustomRotor allows you to create custom rotor items, each of which represents a specific type of content or functionality in your app. For example, you can create rotor items for navigating through headings, images, or other elements.

2. VoiceOver Integration: Rotor items are used in conjunction with VoiceOver, an iOS screen reader. Users can activate VoiceOver and then use custom rotors to navigate through content more efficiently.

3. Accessibility Enhancements: Custom rotors can significantly improve the user experience for individuals with visual impairments. They provide a way to access and interact with content quickly without having to navigate through all elements sequentially.

4. Dynamic and Contextual: You can create custom rotor items that are dynamic and context-sensitive. This means that the available rotor items can change based on the currently focused element or the user's context.

5. Set Focus: Rotor items can be used to programmatically set focus to specific elements, allowing users to jump directly to relevant content.

Here's a basic example of how to create and use a UIAccessibilityCustomRotor to define custom rotor items:
*/

import UIKit

class CustomRotorViewController: UIViewController {
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
        // Create a custom rotor item
        let rotorItem = UIAccessibilityCustomRotorItemResult(targetElement: someElement)
        
        // Create a custom rotor
        let customRotor = UIAccessibilityCustomRotor(name: "Custom Rotor Name", itemSearchBlock: { (predicate) -> UIAccessibilityCustomRotorItemResult? in
            // Implement logic to find and return rotor items based on the predicate
            // Return nil if no items match the predicate
            return rotorItem
        })
        
      
    }

}
