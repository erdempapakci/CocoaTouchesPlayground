 Custom Keyboard Shortcuts: UIKeyCommand enables you to create custom keyboard shortcuts that trigger specific actions within your app. These shortcuts can be used to perform common tasks without relying solely on touch or mouse input.
 Accessibility: Keyboard shortcuts can greatly improve the accessibility of your app. They are particularly helpful for users who may have difficulty with touch-based or mouse-based interactions.
 Key Combination: You can define a key combination (e.g., Command-C) along with a set of modifiers (e.g., Command, Control, Shift) that the user must press to trigger the associated action.
 Responder Chain: UIKeyCommand objects are typically associated with a UIResponder, such as a view controller, and they are added to the app's key commands. When a key combination is pressed, the key command is sent up the responder chain to the first UIResponder that can handle it.
 Global and Local Commands: You can specify whether a key command is local to a specific view controller or global, meaning it can be triggered from anywhere within your app.
 Example Usage: Common use cases for UIKeyCommand include implementing keyboard shortcuts for common actions like copy (Command-C), paste (Command-V), undo (Command-Z), redo (Command-Shift-Z), and navigation within your app.
