/*
 Size Constraints: You can use UISceneSizeRestrictions to define constraints on the size of a scene. These constraints can specify a minimum size, a maximum size, or both. For example, you can set a minimum width and height to ensure that the scene is never smaller than a certain size.
 Size Class: UISceneSizeRestrictions allows you to specify size constraints for specific size classes, such as compact or regular, allowing you to adapt the layout and behavior of your scene based on the available screen space.
 Orientation: You can define size constraints based on the device's orientation (portrait or landscape). This can be useful for scenarios where you want to provide different layout options in different orientations.
 Screen Scale: You can also consider the screen scale (retina or non-retina) when specifying size constraints. This can be helpful for optimizing content for different screen resolutions.
 Initialization: You can create an instance of UISceneSizeRestrictions by specifying the desired size constraints using its initializer.
