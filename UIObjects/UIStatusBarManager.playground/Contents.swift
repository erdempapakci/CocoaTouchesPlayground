/*
 UIStatusBarManager is a class in UIKit on iOS that provides information about the status bar's appearance and behavior. The status bar is the thin strip at the top of the screen that displays various system information such as the time, battery status, and network connectivity.

 UIStatusBarManager is primarily used for managing the appearance of the status bar in your app. You can use it to control aspects such as:

 Status Bar Style: You can set the status bar style (light content or dark content) to ensure it's readable against the background of your app's content.
 Hidden Status Bar: You can hide or show the status bar depending on your app's requirements. For example, you might hide it when displaying full-screen media.
 Status Bar Animation: You can control the animation of status bar changes, such as when it appears or disappears.
