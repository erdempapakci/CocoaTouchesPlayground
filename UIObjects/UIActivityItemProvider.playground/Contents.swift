/*
UIActivityItemProvider is a class in the UIKit framework that's used to provide data to the iOS sharing system when the user performs sharing actions, such as sending content via email or posting on social media. It allows you to generate the data that will be shared based on your app's content and context. Here's what UIActivityItemProvider represents and how it is typically used:

1. Data Provider: UIActivityItemProvider is a data provider class. You subclass it to create a custom provider for the data you want to share. This data could be text, URLs, images, or any other type of content that can be shared.

2. Customization: You override the necessary methods in your UIActivityItemProvider subclass to provide the data that should be shared. These methods include item, which returns the actual data, and activityViewController, which returns a view controller for customizing the sharing process.

3. Lazy Loading: Data generation is typically done lazily. The data is generated only when requested by the sharing system or the user. This helps improve performance by avoiding unnecessary data processing.

4. Async Data: You can generate the data asynchronously if it takes time to fetch or compute. This ensures that your app remains responsive while the data is being prepared.

5. Context-Aware: You can customize the data you provide based on the context. For example, you might provide a different text description for sharing depending on whether the user is sharing via email or a social media post.

Here's a basic example of how to create a UIActivityItemProvider subclass to provide a URL for sharing:
*/

import UIKit

class MyActivityItemProvider: UIActivityItemProvider {
    let url: URL
    
    init(url: URL) {
        self.url = url
        super.init(placeholderItem: url)
    }
    
    override var item: Any {
        return url
    }
    
    override func activityViewController(_ activityViewController: UIActivityViewController, dataTypeIdentifierForActivityType activityType: UIActivity.ActivityType?) -> String {
        // Customize the data type identifier for specific activity types (if needed)
        return "public.url"
    }
}
