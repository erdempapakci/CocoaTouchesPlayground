/*
 UIToolTipInteraction is a class introduced in iOS 15 and later as part of Apple's UIKit framework. It provides a way to display tooltips for user interface elements like buttons, labels, and other views. Tooltips are brief informational messages that appear when the user interacts with an element, typically by hovering over it or tapping and holding it.

 Here are some key points about UIToolTipInteraction:

 Tooltips: UIToolTipInteraction is used to display tooltips, which are short, contextual messages that provide information about the purpose or functionality of a user interface element. Tooltips are often used to enhance the user experience by providing additional guidance or clarifications.
 User Interaction: Tooltips are triggered when the user interacts with a specific view, such as by hovering over it with the mouse pointer or tapping and holding it on a touch screen device.
 Customization: You can customize the content of the tooltip, including the text and appearance. This allows you to tailor the tooltip's content to the specific element it is associated with.
 Automatic Dismissal: Tooltips can automatically dismiss after a certain period or when the user interacts with another part of the app.
 Accessibility: Tooltips are designed to be accessible, ensuring that users with disabilities can also benefit from the additional information they provide.
