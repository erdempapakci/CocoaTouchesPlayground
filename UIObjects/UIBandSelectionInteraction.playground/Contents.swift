/*
 UIBandSelectionInteraction is a new interaction object introduced in iOS 15 that allows users to select a range of items in a view with a single tap and drag. It is designed for use with pointer-based input devices, such as the Apple Pencil and Magic Trackpad.

 To use UIBandSelectionInteraction, you first need to create an instance of the class and add it to the view that contains the items you want to be selectable. Once you have added the interaction object, you can specify a handler to be called when the user selects a range of items.
