/*
 
UICollectionViewFocusUpdateContext is a class in UIKit that provides information about a focus update in a UICollectionView. It is used in conjunction with the focus system to track changes in focus state within the collection view, particularly when navigating with a hardware or software keyboard.

Key points about UICollectionViewFocusUpdateContext:

1. Focus System: UICollectionViewFocusUpdateContext is part of the UIKit's focus system, which is responsible for managing the focus state of user interface elements. Focus is essential for accessibility and navigation within apps, especially on tvOS and for keyboard users on other platforms.

2. Focus Transition: This context class is used to convey information about a transition in focus from one item to another within the collection view. This transition could be triggered by user input, programmatic changes, or automatic focus updates.

3. Focus Environment: UICollectionViewFocusUpdateContext provides the previous focused item (`previouslyFocusedIndexPath`) and the currently focused item (`nextFocusedIndexPath`). It allows you to understand which items are gaining or losing focus.

4. Navigation Feedback: You can use the information provided by UICollectionViewFocusUpdateContext to implement navigation feedback, such as highlighting the currently focused item or scrolling the collection view to bring the focused item into view.

5. UIKit Integration: UICollectionViewFocusUpdateContext is integrated with UICollectionView's focus-related methods and delegate callbacks, making it a crucial component for managing focus within collection views.
