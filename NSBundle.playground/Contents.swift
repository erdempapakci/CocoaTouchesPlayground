/*
 NSBundle was part of the Foundation framework in Objective-C and was used to interact with bundles in macOS and iOS applications. Bundles are directories that contain resources, such as code, images, and localized strings, that are needed for an app to run. However, in modern development, the usage of NSBundle has been largely replaced by Swift-native constructs and APIs.

 Some key concepts related to NSBundle include:

 Accessing Resources: NSBundle was commonly used to access resources like images, sounds, plists, and other files bundled with an application. Developers could use it to locate and load these resources.
 Localization: It provided methods for loading localized versions of resources based on the user's language and region settings.
 Main Bundle: The main bundle represents the bundle containing the application's executable code and resources.
 Framework Bundles: It allowed you to access resources from framework bundles or other bundles within your app's file system.
 Path Handling: It provided methods to access files within the bundle, obtain paths to resources, and check for the existence of files.
