/*
 UIIndirectScribbleInteraction is a class in UIKit that allows you to implement Scribble interactions on views that are not formally text inputs. This means that you can allow users to write in any view, such as a canvas or a drawing pad, and have the text converted to digital text.

 To use UIIndirectScribbleInteraction, you first need to create a new instance of the class. You then need to specify the view that you want to allow Scribble interactions on.

 Once you have created a UIIndirectScribbleInteraction object, you need to add it to the view's gesture recognizers. You can do this using the addGestureRecognizer(_:) method.
