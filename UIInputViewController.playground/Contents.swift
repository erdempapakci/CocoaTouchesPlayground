 Custom Keyboard Layout: You can design a custom keyboard layout with keys and buttons that match the specific needs of your app or input method.
 Input Methods: Beyond standard text input, you can implement custom input methods, such as gesture-based typing, handwriting recognition, or specialized symbols.
 Emoji and Special Characters: Custom keyboards can include emoji, special characters, and symbols tailored to a specific theme or purpose.
 Settings and Preferences: Users can customize the behavior of your custom keyboard through the Settings app on their device.
 Predictive Text and Auto-Correction: You can implement predictive text suggestions and auto-correction features in your custom keyboard.
 Emoji Prediction: Some custom keyboards offer emoji prediction, which suggests relevant emojis based on the user's text input.
 Custom Actions: You can implement custom actions or shortcuts in your keyboard, allowing users to perform specific tasks without leaving the keyboard.
 Security and Privacy: Custom keyboards run in a sandboxed environment to ensure user privacy and data security.
 Here's a basic outline of how to create a custom keyboard using UIInputViewController:

 Create a new iOS project in Xcode with a Keyboard Extension target.
 In your Keyboard Extension target, subclass UIInputViewController to create your custom keyboard logic. Implement methods for handling user input, managing the keyboard's appearance, and configuring its behavior.
 Design your keyboard layout by creating custom keyboard views and buttons. You can use Interface Builder or create them programmatically.
 Implement input methods and handling for user interactions with the keyboard.
 Test your custom keyboard in the iOS Simulator or on a physical device.
 Once your custom keyboard is ready, you can submit it to the App Store so users can download and install it on their devices.
 It's important to note that creating a custom keyboard is a non-trivial task that requires a good understanding of iOS development and user interface design. Apple provides extensive documentation and guidelines for creating custom keyboards, so be sure to refer to those resources when developing your keyboard extension.
