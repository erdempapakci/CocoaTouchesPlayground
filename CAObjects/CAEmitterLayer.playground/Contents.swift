/*
CAEmitterLayer is a fundamental class in iOS development used for creating particle systems and animating particles. Here's what it represents:

1. Particle System: CAEmitterLayer allows you to generate and control a system of particles, such as snowflakes, sparks, or confetti, within your app's user interface.

2. Ideal for Visual Effects: It is commonly used to add dynamic and eye-catching visual effects to applications, games, and animations.

3. Core Animation Integration: CAEmitterLayer integrates seamlessly with Core Animation and UIKit, making it easy to add particle animations to your UIViews and layers.

4. Performance and Efficiency: CAEmitterLayer is designed for efficiency and performance, ensuring smooth and responsive animations, even with a large number of particles.

Here's an example of how to create and use a CAEmitterLayer to generate particle animations:
*/

import UIKit
import QuartzCore

// Create an Emitter Layer
let emitterLayer = CAEmitterLayer()

// Create Emitter Cells (Particles)
let emitterCell = CAEmitterCell()

// Customize the emitter cell properties here (e.g., image, birth rate, lifetime, velocity, etc.).

// Configure Emitter Layer with Emitter Cells
emitterLayer.emitterCells = [emitterCell]

// Set the Position and Size of the Emitter Layer
emitterLayer.position = CGPoint(x: view.bounds.width / 2, y: view.bounds.height / 2)
emitterLayer.bounds = view.bounds

// Add the Emitter Layer to the View's Layer Hierarchy
view.layer.addSublayer(emitterLayer)
