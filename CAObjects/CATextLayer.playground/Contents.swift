/*
CATextLayer is a fundamental class in iOS development used for rendering and displaying text within a layer. It provides a high-performance way to render and animate text within your iOS app. Here's what it represents:

1. Text Rendering: CATextLayer is designed for efficiently rendering and displaying text onscreen. It's part of Core Animation and can be used to display text within layers and animations.

2. Vector Graphics: Unlike UILabel, which is bitmap-based, CATextLayer renders text as vector graphics, ensuring sharp and high-quality text rendering at different resolutions and sizes.

3. Customization: You can customize various text attributes, such as font, color, alignment, and more, to achieve the desired text appearance.

Here's an example of how to create and use a CATextLayer to display text within a view:
*/

import UIKit
import QuartzCore

// Create a CATextLayer
let textLayer = CATextLayer()
textLayer.frame = CGRect(x: 50, y: 50, width: 200, height: 100)

// Configure the text layer's text and appearance
textLayer.string = "Hello, CATextLayer!"
textLayer.fontSize = 18.0
textLayer.foregroundColor = UIColor.blue.cgColor
textLayer.alignmentMode = .center

// Add the text layer to your view's layer hierarchy
let containerView = UIView(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 300, height: 200))
containerView.layer.addSublayer(textLayer)

// Now, you have a CATextLayer displaying "Hello, CATextLayer!" with custom appearance.
