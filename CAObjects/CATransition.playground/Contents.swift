/*
CATransition is a class in iOS development used for adding animated transitions between different views or layers. It allows you to create visually appealing animations when switching from one view to another. Here's what it represents:

1. View Transitions: CATransition is commonly used to add transitions when changing the content or appearance of a view. You can use it to create slide-ins, fade-ins, or other types of animations when transitioning between views.

2. Flexible Animation Styles: CATransition supports various animation styles, including push, move in, crossfade, and more. You can customize the animation type, duration, and timing curve to achieve the desired transition effect.

3. UIKit Integration: CATransition can be applied to UIViews and their layer properties, making it a convenient way to add transitions to user interfaces built with UIKit.

Here's an example of how to create and use a CATransition to add a fade-in transition to a view:
*/

import UIKit
import QuartzCore

// Create a container view
let containerView = UIView(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 300, height: 200))
containerView.backgroundColor = UIColor.lightGray

// Create a view to transition in
let newView = UIView(frame: CGRect(x: 50, y: 50, width: 200, height: 100))
newView.backgroundColor = UIColor.blue

// Add the new view to the container view
containerView.addSubview(newView)

// Create a CATransition
let transition = CATransition()
transition.type = CATransitionType.fade // Set the transition type to fade
transition.duration = 1.0 // Set the duration of the transition

// Apply the transition to the container view's layer
containerView.layer.add(transition, forKey: "fadeTransition")

// Add the container view to the main view
let mainView = UIView(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 300, height: 200))
mainView.addSubview(containerView)

// Now, when you add or remove subviews within the container view, the transition will apply.
