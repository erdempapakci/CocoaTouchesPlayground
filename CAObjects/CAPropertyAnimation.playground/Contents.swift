/*
CAPropertyAnimation is a fundamental class in iOS development used for animating a specific property of a layer. Here's what it represents:

1. Property-Based Animation: CAPropertyAnimation is used for animating individual properties of a CALayer, such as position, opacity, or transform. It allows you to create animations that change specific attributes of a layer over time.

2. UIKit Integration: It seamlessly integrates with UIKit components, making it easy to animate properties of views and layers within your iOS apps.

3. Core Animation Framework: CAPropertyAnimation is part of the Core Animation framework, which provides advanced animation and compositing capabilities for iOS applications.

Here's an example of how to create and use a CAPropertyAnimation to animate the position of a UIView:
*/

import UIKit
import QuartzCore

// Create a UIView to animate
let animatedView = UIView(frame: CGRect(x: 50, y: 50, width: 100, height: 100))
animatedView.backgroundColor = UIColor.blue

// Add the view to your view hierarchy
let containerView = UIView(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 300, height: 300))
containerView.addSubview(animatedView)

// Create a basic CAPropertyAnimation for changing the view's position
let positionAnimation = CABasicAnimation(keyPath: "position")

// Define the animation properties
positionAnimation.fromValue = CGPoint(x: 50, y: 50)
positionAnimation.toValue = CGPoint(x: 200, y: 200)
positionAnimation.duration = 2.0
positionAnimation.timingFunction = CAMediaTimingFunction(name: .easeOut)

// Add the animation to the view's layer
animatedView.layer.add(positionAnimation, forKey: "positionAnimation")

// The view's position will now be animated from (50, 50) to (200, 200).
