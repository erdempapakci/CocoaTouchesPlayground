/*
CAMediaTimingFunction is a fundamental class in iOS development used for controlling the timing and pacing of animations in Core Animation. Here's what it represents:

1. Timing Control: CAMediaTimingFunction allows you to specify the timing curve for animations. It defines how an animation progresses over time, affecting its speed and easing.

2. Timing Functions: It provides predefined timing functions such as ease-in, ease-out, and linear, or you can create custom timing functions to achieve specific animation effects.

3. UIKit Integration: CAMediaTimingFunction seamlessly integrates with animations applied to UIViews, CALayers, and other Core Animation objects.

Here's an example of how to create and use a CAMediaTimingFunction to control the timing of a UIView animation:
*/

import UIKit

// Create a UIView to animate
let animatedView = UIView(frame: CGRect(x: 50, y: 50, width: 100, height: 100))
animatedView.backgroundColor = UIColor.blue

// Add the view to your view hierarchy
let containerView = UIView(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 300, height: 300))
containerView.addSubview(animatedView)

// Create a basic animation for changing the view's position
let positionAnimation = CABasicAnimation(keyPath: "position.y")
positionAnimation.fromValue = 50
positionAnimation.toValue = 200
positionAnimation.duration = 2.0

// Create a CAMediaTimingFunction with a predefined timing curve (ease-in)
let timingFunction = CAMediaTimingFunction(name: .easeIn)

// Apply the timing function to the animation
positionAnimation.timingFunction = timingFunction

// Add the animation to the view's layer
animatedView.layer.add(positionAnimation, forKey: "positionAnimation")

// The view's position will now be animated with an ease-in timing curve.
