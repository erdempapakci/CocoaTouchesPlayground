/*
CAKeyframeAnimation is a fundamental class in iOS development used for creating complex animations that involve multiple keyframes. Here's what it represents:

1. Keyframe Animations: CAKeyframeAnimation allows you to create animations with multiple keyframes, where each keyframe represents a specific state or position in the animation.

2. Precise Control: It provides precise control over the animation path and timing. You can define the values, timing functions, and duration for each keyframe.

3. Versatility: CAKeyframeAnimation is versatile and can be used for various animations, including position animations, rotation animations, and custom property animations.

4. UIKit Integration: It easily integrates with UIKit components, allowing you to animate views and layers within your iOS apps.

Here's an example of how to create and use a CAKeyframeAnimation to animate the position of a UIView:
*/

import UIKit
import QuartzCore

// Create a UIView to animate
let animatedView = UIView(frame: CGRect(x: 50, y: 50, width: 100, height: 100))
animatedView.backgroundColor = UIColor.blue

// Add the view to your view hierarchy
let containerView = UIView(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 300, height: 300))
containerView.addSubview(animatedView)

// Create a CAKeyframeAnimation for position
let positionAnimation = CAKeyframeAnimation(keyPath: "position")

// Define the keyframes (positions)
let startPoint = CGPoint(x: 50, y: 50)
let endPoint = CGPoint(x: 200, y: 200)
positionAnimation.values = [startPoint, CGPoint(x: 100, y: 100), endPoint]

// Define the timing function for each keyframe (ease-in, ease-out, linear)
positionAnimation.timingFunctions = [CAMediaTimingFunction(name: .easeIn), CAMediaTimingFunction(name: .easeOut), CAMediaTimingFunction(name: .linear)]

// Set the duration for each keyframe
positionAnimation.keyTimes = [0.0, 0.5, 1.0]
positionAnimation.duration = 2.0

// Add the animation to the view's layer
animatedView.layer.add(positionAnimation, forKey: "positionAnimation")

// The view's position will now be animated from the start point to the end point using keyframe animation.
