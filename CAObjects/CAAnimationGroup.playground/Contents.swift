/*
CAAnimationGroup is a fundamental class in iOS development used for grouping and managing animations in Core Animation. Here's what it represents:

1. Core Animation Grouping: CAAnimationGroup allows you to group multiple CAAnimation objects together. This grouping enables you to run multiple animations simultaneously or sequentially as a single unit.

2. Simultaneous or Sequential Execution: You can specify whether the animations within the group should run simultaneously or sequentially, providing precise control over complex animation sequences.

3. Managing Complex Animations: CAAnimationGroup is especially valuable when creating complex animations that involve multiple properties or views. By grouping animations, you can manage them as a cohesive entity.

Here's a simple example of how to create and use a CAAnimationGroup to run two animations simultaneously:
*/

import UIKit

// Create a UIView that you want to animate.
let myView = UIView(frame: CGRect(x: 50, y: 50, width: 100, height: 100))
myView.backgroundColor = UIColor.blue

// Add the view to your view hierarchy.
let containerView = UIView(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 300, height: 300))
containerView.addSubview(myView)

// Create a CABasicAnimation for animating the position.
let positionAnimation = CABasicAnimation(keyPath: "position")
positionAnimation.fromValue = NSValue(cgPoint: myView.layer.position)
positionAnimation.toValue = NSValue(cgPoint: CGPoint(x: 200, y: 200))
positionAnimation.duration = 2.0 // Animation duration in seconds

// Create a CABasicAnimation for animating the opacity.
let opacityAnimation = CABasicAnimation(keyPath: "opacity")
opacityAnimation.fromValue = 1.0
opacityAnimation.toValue = 0.5
opacityAnimation.duration = 2.0

// Create a CAAnimationGroup to run both animations simultaneously.
let animationGroup = CAAnimationGroup()
animationGroup.animations = [positionAnimation, opacityAnimation]
animationGroup.duration = 2.0 // Set the group's duration to match the individual animations.

// Add the animation group to the view's layer.
myView.layer.add(animationGroup, forKey: "simultaneousAnimation")

// This code creates a group of animations and runs both position and opacity animations simultaneously.
