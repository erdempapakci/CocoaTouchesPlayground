/*
CAValueFunction is a class in iOS development used for defining custom animations that modify layer properties. It allows you to create complex animations by specifying how values should be calculated and applied to layer properties over time. Here's what it represents:

1. Custom Animation Functions: CAValueFunction enables you to define custom animation functions to control how a layer's properties change over time. You can use it to create animations that aren't possible with standard animation types.

2. Property Manipulation: You can use CAValueFunction to manipulate various layer properties, such as position, rotation, scale, and more. It gives you fine-grained control over how these properties change during animations.

3. Core Animation Integration: CAValueFunction is integrated with Core Animation, making it a powerful tool for creating advanced animations within a layered user interface.

Here's an example of how to create and use a CAValueFunction to create a custom position animation:
*/

import UIKit
import QuartzCore

// Create a view to be animated
let animatedView = UIView(frame: CGRect(x: 50, y: 50, width: 100, height: 100))
animatedView.backgroundColor = UIColor.blue

// Add the view to your view hierarchy
let containerView = UIView(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 300, height: 300))
containerView.addSubview(animatedView)

// Create a basic animation for the x-position
let positionAnimation = CABasicAnimation(keyPath: "position.x")
positionAnimation.fromValue = animatedView.layer.position.x
positionAnimation.toValue = 200.0
positionAnimation.duration = 2.0

// Create a custom animation using CAValueFunction for the y-position
let yPositionAnimation = CABasicAnimation(keyPath: "position.y")
yPositionAnimation.fromValue = animatedView.layer.position.y
yPositionAnimation.toValue = 200.0
yPositionAnimation.duration = 2.0

// Create a CAValueFunction that defines a custom animation function
let valueFunction = CAValueFunction(name: CAValueFunctionName.cubic)

// Assign the CAValueFunction to the animation's timing function
yPositionAnimation.timingFunction = CAMediaTimingFunction(name: .easeInEaseOut)
yPositionAnimation.valueFunction = valueFunction

// Group the animations
let group = CAAnimationGroup()
group.animations = [positionAnimation, yPositionAnimation]
group.duration = 2.0

// Add the animation to the view's layer
animatedView.layer.add(group, forKey: "positionAnimation")

// The view will now animate its x and y positions using custom animation functions.
