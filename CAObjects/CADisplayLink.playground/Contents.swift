/*
CADisplayLink is a fundamental class in iOS development used for synchronizing animations with the refresh rate of the device's screen. Here's what it represents:

1. Synchronized Animations: CADisplayLink provides a way to schedule animations that are synchronized with the screen's refresh rate. It ensures that your animations are smooth and run at the optimal frame rate.

2. Ideal for Complex Animations: It's particularly useful for complex or custom animations that cannot be achieved with standard UIKit or Core Animation APIs. You have full control over the drawing and updating process.

3. Timer Alternative: CADisplayLink is often used as an alternative to using timers or delays for animations, as it provides more accurate and efficient control over animations.

4. UIKit and Core Animation Integration: You can use CADisplayLink in conjunction with UIKit and Core Animation to create high-quality, custom animations in your iOS apps.

// This code creates a CADisplayLink that calls the handleDisplayLink method on every frame update. Inside the method, you can update your animation properties based on the animation progress.
