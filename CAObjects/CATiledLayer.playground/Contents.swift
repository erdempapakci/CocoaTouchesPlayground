/*
CATiledLayer is a specialized class in iOS development used for displaying and efficiently rendering large or zoomable content, such as high-resolution images or maps. It's designed to provide smooth and responsive user experiences when dealing with large or zoomable views. Here's what it represents:

1. Tiled Content: CATiledLayer divides the content into smaller tiles, allowing it to load and render only the visible tiles on the screen. This approach improves performance and reduces memory usage for large or zoomable views.

2. Dynamic Loading: As the user pans or zooms, CATiledLayer dynamically loads and renders the tiles needed for the current view. This ensures that only the visible portion of the content is rendered, even for very large images or zoom levels.

3. Seamless Zooming: CATiledLayer is commonly used in scenarios where seamless zooming and navigation of high-resolution images or maps are required. It supports smooth zoom transitions by loading higher-resolution tiles when zooming in and lower-resolution tiles when zooming out.

Here's an example of how to create and use a CATiledLayer to display a large image:
*/

import UIKit
import QuartzCore

// Create a custom UIView subclass that uses CATiledLayer
class TiledImageView: UIView {
    override class var layerClass: AnyClass {
        return CATiledLayer.self
    }
    
    override init(frame: CGRect) {
        super.init(frame: frame)
        // Enable drawing for the entire bounds of the view
        self.contentMode = .redraw
    }
    
    required init?(coder aDecoder: NSCoder) {
        fatalError("init(coder:) has not been implemented")
    }
    
    override func draw(_ rect: CGRect) {
        // Draw the content for the current tile
        guard let context = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext() else { return }
        
        // Customize the drawing here, e.g., rendering a portion of a large image
        let tileRect = CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: rect.width, height: rect.height)
        UIColor.blue.setFill()
        context.fill(tileRect)
    }
}

// Create a tiled image view
let tiledImageView = TiledImageView(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 300, height: 200))

// Add the tiled image view to your view hierarchy
let containerView = UIView(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 300, height: 200))
containerView.addSubview(tiledImageView)

// Now, you have a CATiledLayer-based view capable of efficiently displaying large or zoomable content.
