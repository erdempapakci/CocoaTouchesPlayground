/*


 Organizing Images: You can create an asset catalog in your Xcode project and add images to it. Images in an asset catalog are organized into sets, allowing you to group related images together. This organization makes it easier to manage and reference images in your app.
 Device and Display Variants: Asset catalogs automatically handle device-specific and display mode-specific variations of images. For example, you can provide different images for standard displays and high-resolution Retina displays without writing complex code to load the appropriate image.
 Appearance Variants: You can create appearance-based variants of images for light mode and dark mode. This allows your app's images to adapt to the user's selected appearance without additional code.
 Accessibility Variants: Asset catalogs support accessibility variants, enabling you to provide alternative images for different accessibility settings, such as dynamic type sizes or invert colors.
