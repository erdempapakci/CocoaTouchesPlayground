/*
UICollectionViewController is a specialized view controller in iOS development designed for managing and displaying collection views. Here's what it represents:

1. Collection View Controller: UICollectionViewController is a subclass of UIViewController specifically tailored for managing collection views. It simplifies the process of handling collection view data and user interactions.

2. User Interface Management: UICollectionViewController streamlines the integration of collection views into your app's user interface. It provides methods and properties to manage collection view content, cells, and interactions.

3. UIKit Framework: UICollectionViewController is part of the UIKit framework, a fundamental framework for creating iOS user interfaces. Importing UIKit provides access to UICollectionViewController and other UI-related classes and utilities.

In your code, you create custom UICollectionViewController subclasses to control the behavior of collection views within your app. Each UICollectionViewController manages the data source and delegate for a collection view, making it easy to display grid-based layouts of data.

import UIKit

// Importing UIKit framework to use UICollectionViewController.

// Create a custom class named MyCollectionViewController that derives from UICollectionViewController.

class MyCollectionViewController: UICollectionViewController {
    
    // This class inherits from UICollectionViewController, designed for managing and displaying collection views.

    // You can override UICollectionViewController's methods to customize collection view behavior and appearance.

    // For example, you can implement collectionView(_:numberOfItemsInSection:) and collectionView(_:cellForItemAt:) to populate the collection view with data.
    override func collectionView(_ collectionView: UICollectionView, numberOfItemsInSection section: Int) -> Int {
        // Return the number of items in the collection view.
        return 20
    }

    override func collectionView(_ collectionView: UICollectionView, cellForItemAt indexPath: IndexPath) -> UICollectionViewCell {
        // Create and return a cell for the given index path.
        let cell = collectionView.dequeueReusableCell(withReuseIdentifier: "Cell", for: indexPath) as UICollectionViewCell
    
    //    cell.titleLabel.text = "Item \(indexPath.item + 1)"
        return cell
    }

    // You can add custom methods and properties to tailor the collection view controller's functionality to your app's requirements.
}

// To use this custom collection view controller, you can instantiate it and present it within your app's navigation flow.

// For example:
// let customCollectionViewController = MyCollectionViewController(collectionViewLayout: UICollectionViewFlowLayout())
// navigationController?.pushViewController(customCollectionViewController, animated: true)

// This code creates an instance of MyCollectionViewController and pushes it onto the navigation stack to display a collection view within a navigation controller.
