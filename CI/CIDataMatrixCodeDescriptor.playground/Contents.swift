/*
CIDataMatrixCodeDescriptor is a class in iOS development used for creating and configuring descriptors that contain information about Data Matrix codes. Data Matrix codes are two-dimensional barcodes that can store various types of data, including text, numbers, and binary data. With CIDataMatrixCodeDescriptor, you can generate Data Matrix symbols and customize their properties. Here's what it represents:

1. Data Matrix Generation: CIDataMatrixCodeDescriptor is used to generate Data Matrix symbols. You provide the data you want to encode, and it produces a Data Matrix image representing that data.

2. Descriptor Configuration: You can configure various properties of the Data Matrix descriptor, including the data encoding, error correction level, and module size. These properties allow you to tailor the Data Matrix code to your specific needs.

3. Core Image Integration: CIDataMatrixCodeDescriptor is part of the Core Image framework, making it easy to incorporate Data Matrix code generation into your iOS apps.

Here's an example of how to create and use a CIDataMatrixCodeDescriptor to generate a Data Matrix code from a string:
