/*
CIImageProcessorKernel is a class introduced in the Core Image framework in iOS 15 and macOS 12. It is used for creating custom image processing kernels that can be applied to CIImage objects. Image processing kernels allow you to define custom operations to manipulate image data efficiently. Here's what CIImageProcessorKernel represents:

1. Custom Image Processing: CIImageProcessorKernel enables you to define custom image processing operations that can be applied to CIImage instances. These operations can include pixel-level manipulations, filters, and various effects.

2. High Performance: Image processor kernels are designed to be highly optimized and efficient. They take advantage of GPU acceleration for faster image processing, making them suitable for real-time and performance-critical applications.

3. Flexibility: You have the flexibility to define your own image processing logic using Swift or Metal shading language, depending on the platform. This allows you to create a wide range of custom effects and manipulations.

4. Integration with Core Image: Image processor kernels seamlessly integrate with Core Image, which means you can incorporate your custom kernels into your existing Core Image workflows alongside built-in filters and operations.

Here's a basic example of how to create and use a CIImageProcessorKernel to perform a simple image processing operation:
