/*
CIRenderDestination is a class in the Core Image framework that represents a rendering target for image processing operations performed using Core Image. It allows you to specify where the result of an image processing operation should be rendered or saved. Here's what CIRenderDestination represents:

1. Rendering Target: CIRenderDestination defines the destination for rendering the result of a Core Image operation. You can use it to specify various rendering targets, such as images, metal textures, and more.

2. Flexible Output: It provides flexibility in how you want to capture or render the output of Core Image operations. For example, you can use it to create images, save to files, or populate metal textures, among other possibilities.

3. Integration with Core Image: CIRenderDestination is integrated into the Core Image workflow. You can set it up as a target when creating a CIContext to control where the output of image processing operations goes.

4. Options and Properties: You can customize the behavior of CIRenderDestination by setting properties and options such as the color space, size, and format of the output.

Here's a basic example of how to use CIRenderDestination to render the output of a Core Image filter into a new CGImage:
