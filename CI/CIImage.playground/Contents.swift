/*
CIImage is a class in iOS development used for representing and manipulating images in a highly efficient and flexible manner. It's part of the Core Image framework and serves as a fundamental data type for image processing. Here's what it represents:

1. Image Representation: CIImage represents an image or image data that can be used for a wide range of image processing tasks, including filtering, compositing, and transformation. It can represent images from various sources, such as files, camera captures, or in-memory data.

2. Immutable Data: CIImage is immutable, meaning once you create an instance, you cannot change its pixel data directly. Instead, you create new CIImage instances by applying filters and transformations to existing ones.

3. Lazy Evaluation: CIImage uses lazy evaluation, which means that operations on CIImages are not executed immediately. Instead, they create a recipe for image processing that is applied when necessary, helping to optimize performance.

Here's an example of how to create and use a CIImage from a UIImage:
*/

import UIKit
import CoreImage

// Load an image as a UIImage
if let image = UIImage(named: "inputImage") {
    // Create a CIImage from the UIImage
    if let ciImage = CIImage(image: image) {
        // Now you have a CIImage representing the loaded image
        // You can use ciImage for various image processing tasks such as applying filters or transformations.
        
        // For example, you can create a Gaussian blur filter and apply it to the CIImage:
        let gaussianBlurFilter = CIFilter(name: "CIGaussianBlur")
        gaussianBlurFilter?.setValue(ciImage, forKey: kCIInputImageKey)
        gaussianBlurFilter?.setValue(10.0, forKey: kCIInputRadiusKey)
        
        if let outputImage = gaussianBlurFilter?.outputImage {
            // You can now use the outputImage for further processing or display.
        }
    }
}
