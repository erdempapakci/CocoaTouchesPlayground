/*
CIFaceFeature is a class in iOS development that represents detected facial features within an image. It's part of the Core Image framework and is typically used in conjunction with CIDetector for face detection. Here's what it represents:

1. Facial Feature Detection: CIFaceFeature is used to represent individual facial features detected within an image. These features include eyes, mouth, and face bounds. It provides information about the position and characteristics of each detected feature.

2. Core Image Integration: CIFaceFeature is integrated with the Core Image framework, making it easy to extract information about detected facial features within your iOS apps.

Here's an example of how to use CIFaceFeature to access information about detected facial features in a UIImage after performing face detection:
*/

import UIKit
import CoreImage

// Create a CIDetector for face detection
let context = CIContext()
let detector = CIDetector(ofType: CIDetectorTypeFace, context: context, options: [CIDetectorAccuracy: CIDetectorAccuracyHigh])

// Load an image to perform face detection
if let image = UIImage(named: "inputImage") {
    if let ciImage = CIImage(image: image) {
        // Perform face detection
        let features = detector?.features(in: ciImage)
        
        // Process detected faces
        for feature in features as! [CIFaceFeature] {
            print("Face bounds: \(feature.bounds)")
            if feature.hasLeftEyePosition {
                print("Left eye position: \(feature.leftEyePosition)")
            }
            if feature.hasRightEyePosition {
                print("Right eye position: \(feature.rightEyePosition)")
            }
            if feature.hasMouthPosition {
                print("Mouth position: \(feature.mouthPosition)")
            }
            
            // You can access and utilize other properties of CIFaceFeature to further analyze and work with detected facial features.
        }
    }
}
