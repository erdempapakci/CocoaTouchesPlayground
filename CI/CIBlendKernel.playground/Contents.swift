CIBlendKernel is a class in iOS development used for creating custom blend modes in Core Image. Blend modes determine how two images or layers are combined or composited together. With CIBlendKernel, you can define your custom blend modes to achieve specific visual effects. Here's what it represents:

1. Custom Blend Modes: CIBlendKernel allows you to define custom blending operations that dictate how pixel values from two source images are combined. This enables you to create unique and visually appealing effects during image processing.

2. Core Image Integration: CIBlendKernel is integrated with Core Image, making it a powerful tool for customizing image processing operations within a layered user interface.

Here's an example of how to create a custom blend kernel and apply it to two images using Core Image:
