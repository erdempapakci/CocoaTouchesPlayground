/*
CIFeature is a class in iOS development used for representing detected features within an image or video frame. It's part of the Core Image framework and serves as a base class for various feature types, such as faces, rectangles, and more. Here's what it represents:

1. Feature Detection: CIFeature is used to represent detected objects or regions of interest within an image or video frame. It provides information about the position and characteristics of each detected feature.

2. Core Image Integration: CIFeature is integrated with the Core Image framework, making it easy to extract information about detected features within your iOS apps. It's often used in conjunction with CIDetector to detect and analyze objects.

Here's an example of how to use CIFeature to access information about detected features in a UIImage after performing object detection (e.g., face detection):
*/

import UIKit
import CoreImage

// Create a CIDetector for face detection
let context = CIContext()
let detector = CIDetector(ofType: CIDetectorTypeFace, context: context, options: [CIDetectorAccuracy: CIDetectorAccuracyHigh])

// Load an image to perform face detection
if let image = UIImage(named: "inputImage") {
    if let ciImage = CIImage(image: image) {
        // Perform face detection
        let features = detector?.features(in: ciImage)
        
        // Process detected features
        for feature in features ?? [] {
            if let faceFeature = feature as? CIFaceFeature {
                print("Face bounds: \(faceFeature.bounds)")
                if faceFeature.hasLeftEyePosition {
                    print("Left eye position: \(faceFeature.leftEyePosition)")
                }
                if faceFeature.hasRightEyePosition {
                    print("Right eye position: \(faceFeature.rightEyePosition)")
                }
                if faceFeature.hasMouthPosition {
                    print("Mouth position: \(faceFeature.mouthPosition)")
                }
                // You can access and utilize other properties of CIFeature or its subclasses for specific feature types.
            }
        }
    }
}
