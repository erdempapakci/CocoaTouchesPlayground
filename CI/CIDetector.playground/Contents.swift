/*
CIDetector is a class in iOS development used for detecting features in images and videos. It provides the ability to identify faces, eyes, rectangles, and other objects within an image or video stream. Here's what it represents:

1. Object Detection: CIDetector is used for object detection, and it supports various types of detectors, including face detection, text detection, QR code detection, and more. You can choose the type of detector based on your specific requirements.

2. Core Image Integration: CIDetector is integrated with the Core Image framework, making it easy to perform object detection tasks within your iOS apps.

3. Output as CIFeatures: When CIDetector detects objects, it returns an array of CIFeatures objects, each representing a detected object. You can analyze these features to extract information about the detected objects.

Here's an example of how to use CIDetector to detect faces in a UIImage:
*/

import UIKit
import CoreImage

// Create a CIDetector for face detection
let context = CIContext()
let detector = CIDetector(ofType: CIDetectorTypeFace, context: context, options: [CIDetectorAccuracy: CIDetectorAccuracyHigh])

// Load an image to perform face detection
if let image = UIImage(named: "inputImage") {
    if let ciImage = CIImage(image: image) {
        // Perform face detection
        let features = detector?.features(in: ciImage)
        
        // Process detected faces
        for feature in features as! [CIFaceFeature] {
            print("Face bounds: \(feature.bounds)")
            if feature.hasLeftEyePosition {
                print("Left eye position: \(feature.leftEyePosition)")
            }
            if feature.hasRightEyePosition {
                print("Right eye position: \(feature.rightEyePosition)")
            }
            if feature.hasMouthPosition {
                print("Mouth position: \(feature.mouthPosition)")
            }
            // You can extract additional information about the detected faces here
        }
    }
}
