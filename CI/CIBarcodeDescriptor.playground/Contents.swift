/*
CIBarcodeDescriptor is a class in iOS development used for creating and configuring descriptors that contain information about barcodes. Barcodes are widely used for encoding various types of data, such as product information, inventory, and more. With CIBarcodeDescriptor, you can generate barcode symbols and customize their properties. Here's what it represents:

1. Barcode Generation: CIBarcodeDescriptor is used to generate barcode symbols. You provide the data you want to encode, and it produces a barcode image representing that data.

2. Descriptor Configuration: You can configure various properties of the barcode, including the barcode type, data encoding, error correction level, and more. These properties allow you to tailor the barcode to your specific needs.

3. Integration with Core Image: CIBarcodeDescriptor is part of the Core Image framework, making it easy to incorporate barcode generation into your iOS apps.

Here's an example of how to create and use a CIBarcodeDescriptor to generate a QR code from a URL:
