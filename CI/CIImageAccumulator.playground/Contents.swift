/*
CIImageAccumulator is a class in the Core Image framework used for accumulating pixel data from multiple CIImages to create a composite image. It's particularly useful for multi-pass image processing tasks where you need to build up an image from multiple operations. Here's what it represents:

1. Accumulating Pixel Data: CIImageAccumulator allows you to accumulate pixel data from multiple CIImages, creating a composite image over multiple passes of image processing.

2. Iterative Image Processing: It's commonly used when you need to apply a filter or perform custom operations multiple times on an image, where each pass builds on the results of the previous pass.

3. Multisampling and Multiresolution: You can use CIImageAccumulator to create images with multisampling or at different resolutions, which can be useful for various image processing techniques.

4. Creating a Composite Image: After accumulating pixel data, you can create a final CIImage representing the accumulated results, which can be used for display or further processing.

Here's a simplified example of how to use CIImageAccumulator to accumulate pixel data from two images:
*/

import UIKit
import CoreImage

// Load two input images as CIImages
if let image1 = CIImage(image: UIImage(named: "inputImage1")!),
   let image2 = CIImage(image: UIImage(named: "inputImage2")!) {
    
    // Create a CIContext for rendering
    let context = CIContext()
    
    // Specify the desired format and extent for the accumulator
    let format = CIFormat.RGBA8
    let extent = image1.extent.union(image2.extent)
    
    // Create a CIImageAccumulator
    let accumulator = CIImageAccumulator(extent: extent, format: format)
    
    // Render the first image into the accumulator
    context.render(image1, to: accumulator! as! CVPixelBuffer)
    
    // Render the second image into the accumulator, combining with the first
    context.render(image2, to: accumulator as! CVPixelBuffer)
    
    // Create a final CIImage from the accumulator
    let finalImage = accumulator!.image()
    
    // You can use the finalImage for display or further processing
}
