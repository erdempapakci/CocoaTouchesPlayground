/*
UIActivityViewController is a view controller provided by the UIKit framework in iOS. It allows you to present a system-provided interface that enables users to share content from your app with others or perform various actions on that content. The content can be text, images, URLs, or any other data that can be shared.

Here's what UIActivityViewController represents and how it is typically used:

1. Share Sheet: UIActivityViewController presents a share sheet that displays a list of available sharing options and actions. These options include sharing content via Messages, Mail, AirDrop, social media platforms, and more. Users can select an activity to share or perform an action with the provided content.

2. Content Sharing: You can provide an array of items (text, images, URLs, etc.) that you want to share using the activityItems parameter. These items are displayed in the share sheet, and users can choose how they want to share them.

3. Customization: You can customize the presentation of the share sheet by specifying excluded activities, providing a completion handler to handle sharing results, and configuring the share sheet's title and popover source.

4. Activity Items Configuration: In iOS 13 and later, you can use UIActivityItemsConfiguration to configure multiple items with associated metadata and actions for each item. This provides more control over the sharing experience.

5. Asynchronous Data: You can provide data asynchronously if it takes time to fetch or compute. This ensures that your app remains responsive while the data is being prepared for sharing.

Here's a basic example of how to create and present a UIActivityViewController:
*/

import UIKit

class ViewController: UIViewController {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        // Create a UIActivityViewController object
        let activityViewController = UIActivityViewController(activityItems: ["This is some text content."], applicationActivities: nil)

        // Present it to the user
        activityViewController.popoverPresentationController?.sourceView = self.view
        present(activityViewController, animated: true, completion: nil)
    }
}
