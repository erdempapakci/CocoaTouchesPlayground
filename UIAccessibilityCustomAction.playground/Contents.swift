/*
UIAccessibilityCustomAction is a class in the UIKit framework that allows you to define custom actions for accessible elements in your iOS app's user interface. Custom actions can enhance the accessibility of your app by providing additional functionality for users with disabilities. Here's what UIAccessibilityCustomAction represents:

1. Custom Actions: UIAccessibilityCustomAction allows you to define custom actions that users can perform on accessible elements. These actions are additional to the standard gestures or interactions supported by an element.

2. Accessibility Enhancements: Custom actions can make your app more accessible by providing alternative ways for users with disabilities to interact with your interface. For example, you can add a custom action to speak additional information about an element or trigger a specific action when activated.

3. Dynamic and Contextual: Custom actions can be dynamic and contextual, meaning they can change based on the state of the element or the context in which it appears. This flexibility allows you to tailor the accessibility experience for different situations.

4. Associated with UI Elements: Custom actions are associated with UI elements that conform to the UIAccessibility protocol. You typically set custom actions on these elements to make them available to assistive technologies like VoiceOver.

Here's a basic example of how to create and use a UIAccessibilityCustomAction for an accessible element:
*/

import UIKit

class CustomActionViewController: UIViewController {
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
        // Create a custom action
        let customAction = UIAccessibilityCustomAction(name: "Speak Description", target: self, selector: #selector(speakDescription))
        
        // Set the custom action on a UI element
        let accessibleButton = UIButton(type: .system)
        accessibleButton.accessibilityLabel = "Custom Action Button"
        accessibleButton.accessibilityCustomActions = [customAction]
        
        // Add the button to the view
        view.addSubview(accessibleButton)
    }
    
    @objc func speakDescription() {
        // Implement the custom action logic here
        // For example, you can use AVSpeechSynthesizer to speak additional information
    }
}
